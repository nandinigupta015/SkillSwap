# SkillSwap

**SkillSwap** is a prototype of a peer-to-peer skill exchange platform.  
The idea: instead of paying, people can **swap skills** — you teach something you know, and learn something in return.

This project currently contains the **frontend (UI)** built with **HTML, CSS, and JavaScript**.
